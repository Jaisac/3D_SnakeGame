# 3D_SnakeGame
Project of a 3D game of a classical eating fruit Snake

The game works as a classical snake game from nokia phones. A fruit must be eaten to earn points and the snake grown larger. Walls,
bombs and obstacles can cause game over (freeze the game). Bombs and fruits appears randomly around the scene. 

Features to be added:

-Menus for start and settings

-Background music

-Support for mobile phones

-Restart and pause 


Bugs to be fixed
-The snake body, as it grows larger, has a weird bug where its body parts (nodes) get random rotation values, causing them to 
move loosely as its numbers increase during movement.


This project was made by Jaime Perez Gutierrez.
